## Overview
This project implements a deck of cards shuffle program in C. It demonstrates the use of arrays, structures, functions, and randomization to simulate shuffling and displaying a standard deck of playing cards.

The program emphasizes foundational C programming concepts commonly used in embedded systems and low-level software development.

## Features
- Represents a standard 52-card deck
- Implements a shuffle algorithm using random number generation
- Displays card values and suits after shuffling
- Reinforces array indexing, loops, and function modularity

## Files
- `main 5.c` — Main program implementing the deck and shuffle logic  
- `Code-1`, `Code-2` — Supporting code screenshots  
- `Output` — Example program output  
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## Tools & Technologies
- C programming language
- GCC compiler
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`)
- Command-line execution

## How to Run
```bash
gcc main\ 5.c -o deck_shuffle
./deck_shuffle
